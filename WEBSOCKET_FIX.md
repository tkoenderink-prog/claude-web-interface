# WebSocket & Streaming Issues Fix

## Problems Identified

1. **Disconnect Handler Error**: Missing parameter in disconnect handler - **FIXED**
2. **Async Task Error**: Can't create async tasks outside event loop - **FIXED**
3. **Long Response Time**: With 29,041 tokens from knowledge files, Claude takes time to process
4. **WebSocket Timeout**: Connection drops during long processing

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Disconnect Handler
- Added `reason` parameter to handle_disconnect()
- Removed async task creation outside event loop
- Streams now timeout naturally

### 2. Why Responses Take Long
With 10 knowledge files (29,041 tokens), Claude needs to:
- Process all the context
- Generate a comprehensive response
- This can take 30-60 seconds or more

## Recommendations

### For Better Performance:

1. **Use HTTP Instead of WebSocket for Large Requests**
   - Disable streaming in settings
   - HTTP has better timeout handling

2. **Reduce Knowledge Files**
   - Only add relevant files
   - Consider selecting 3-5 most relevant files instead of 10

3. **Add Loading Feedback**
   - The bouncing dots show it's working
   - Consider adding a progress message

### Quick Fix - Force HTTP Mode:
In the browser console, run:
```javascript
window.chatInterface.settings.streaming = false;
```

Then send your message - it will use HTTP which handles long responses better.

## Test with Fewer Files

1. Refresh browser
2. Add only 2-3 knowledge files (instead of 10)
3. Send a simple message
4. Should respond much faster

## Status

- ‚úÖ Claude service is working
- ‚úÖ WebSocket errors fixed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large requests (29k+ tokens) take time
- üí° Consider using HTTP for large knowledge sets
